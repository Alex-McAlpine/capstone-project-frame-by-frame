## Agile Planning

This project utilised an agile methodology for the project. Making use of user stories, wireframes and a kanban board.

# Project Board

A Kanban board is an Agile project management tool that uses columns for workflow stages and cards for tasks, helping teams track progress and identify bottlenecks.

# Wireframes

Wireframes are an essential part of the UI design process. These simple sketches I put together in Canva.com help to bring the application to life before coding had even started. Wireframes help to visualize the placement of elements on the page and guide the development process.

The design didn't change significantly during development but additional features and details were added to enhance the application beyond the initial scope.

# User Stories

User stories are a key component of agile development methodologies. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of the end user. User stories help to capture the requirements of the application in a way that is easy to understand and communicate. They focus on the value that the feature will bring to the user and provide a basis for planning, development, and testing.

All my user stories can be found on the project board.

### Deployment

## Deploying the application to heroku involved several steps.

# Preparing my project for heroku

- My project was uploaded to a github repository
- Gunicorn was installed and configured
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and the python version is listed in .python-version
- Configure static files and settings.py, paying special attention to disabling debugging and any other settings related to security.
- Set up and configure environmental files eg. env.py
create a Procfile. This file tells Heroku how to run your application.
- Ensure that any files that contain secret keys or other sensitive information eg. env.py is added to .gitignore and is not present in your github repo

# Deploying to Heroku

- Create heroku app
- Link github repository & Code Institute PostGres database
- Add environmental variables to heroku, such as, secret keys.
- Deploy the application

### References

### AI

I used AI in both the creative planning phase and during the coding phase. 

AI helped me brainstorm a name for the blog. On top of that, I used AI tools to come up with a colour scheme for the website.

AI was particularly helpful in speeding up certain coding sections, with its ability to create code very quickly.

AI played a key role in troubleshooting when problems did arise, in particular identifying venv issues or local packages missing.
